# fingertipsR

This is an R package to interact with Public Health England's [Fingertips](http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) data tool. Fingertips is a major public repository of population and public health indicators for England. The site presents the information in many ways to improve accessibility for a wide range of audiences ranging from public health professionals and researchers to the general public. The information presented is a mixture of data available from other public sources, and those that are available through user access agreements with other organisations. The source of each indicator presented is available using the `indicator_metadata()` function.

This package can be used to load data from the Fingertips API into R for further use. 

## Installation

### rOpenSci

Get the latest released, stable version from rOpenSci:

```{r CRAN-install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fingertipsR", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")
```

### With remotes

You can install the latest development version from github using [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rOpenSci/fingertipsR",
                        build_vignettes = TRUE,
                        dependencies = "suggests")
```


## Example

This is an example of a workflow for downloading data for the indicator on *Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth* from the *Public Health Outcomes Framework* profile.

The `profiles()` function presents all of the available profiles:

```{r profiles example}
library(fingertipsR)
profs <- profiles()
profs <- profs[grepl("Public Health Outcomes Framework", profs$ProfileName),]
head(profs)
```

This table shows that the `ProfileID` for the Public Health Outcomes Framework is 19. This can be used as an input for the `indicators()` function:

```{r indicators example}
profid <- 19
inds <- indicators(ProfileID = profid)
print(inds[grepl("Healthy", inds$IndicatorName), c("IndicatorID", "IndicatorName")])
```

Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth has the `IndicatorID` equal to 90362.

Finally, the data can be extracted using the `fingertips_data()` function using that `IndicatorID`:

```{r fingertips_data example}
indid <- 90362
df <- fingertips_data(IndicatorID = indid, AreaTypeID = 202)
head(df)
```

## Use

Please see the vignettes for information on use.

```{r use, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("fingertipsR")
```
